NC State ECE 592/CSC 591 Quantum Computing Project One: IBM Q Pulses to Reduce Noise

## Demo Instructions
git clone https://github.ncsu.edu/jrwilde2/ECE592-CSC591_project1.git

**Dependencies:**
- pip install qiskit
- pip install matplotlib
- pip install numpy

**Files to run:**
The source file "calibrate_pi_pulse_updated.ipynb" is the main python notebook that you can run to see the code in the presentation.
The source file "calibrate_pi_pulse_repeatExperiment.ipynb" is similar to the the updated python notebook but we use this one to vary the sigma values of the Gaussian pulse. The excel spreadsheet values has the parameters organized and graphed to determine the best pulse.

## Problem Description
One of the major challenges prevalent in the quantum computing paradigm is noisy quantum devices. Quantum devices, in practice, are often prone to incorrect answers due to noise in the system as a result of decoherence. This limits our ability to have a reliable output from quantum computers in solving problems. Quantum computers with uncorrelated and weak noise can potentially be used to solve intractable problems. A tremendous amount of work has already been done in this area to design more fault-tolerant quantum machines. With our proposed solution, we aim to minimize the noisy results obtained in currently available quantum computers for low level single qubit gates.

IBM quantum computers are controlled with precise pulses that stimulate transmon qubits and manipulate their states. IBM’s Qiskit library contains the Pulse API, which allows users to have pulse-level control of quantum systems. This lower level of programming  allows users to have a greater level of control and implementation of gates and measurements than what is capable with a higher level API like Qiskit’s QuantumCircuit. The pulse level control will allow experimentation with different pulses in order to correct the average noise found in a quantum circuit. Once an optimal pulse is determined, a calibration circuit can be constructed and the base vectors, |0> and |1>, can be redefined. This will allow the reconstruction of standard gates such as Pauli, Hadamard, etc. with comparatively lower noise levels that result in more consistently correct answers.


## Proposed solution
Determine an optimal pulse to correct the average noise found in low-level u1, u2, and u3 gates. Then, using said optimal pulse, develop a calibration circuit.
- Begin with IBM’s default pulses for 180 degree rotations around the X and Z axis to develop an understanding of how to use Qiskit Pulse and manipulate pulses to achieve a certain result.
- Use OpenPulse to understand how a C-NOT gate works and how pulses can be used to correct it’s result.
- Develop Pauli, C-NOT, and Hadamard gates using known pulse algorithms.
- Experiment with different pulses for low-level u1, u2, and u3 gates:
	- Run multiple simulations of u1, u2, and u3 gates with Qiskit Pulse and define an average error or noise level to be corrected using an optimal pulse.
	- As a baseline, a set of default pulse values and parameters will be initially selected and simulated on the standard u1, u2, and u3 gates to develop an understanding of the noise correction.
	- Experiment with different pulses until an optimal pulse is determined in order to correct the average error generated by the standard u1, u2, and u3 gates.
- Once the optimal pulse is found, develop a calibration circuit to be used to correct the error generated by the standard u1, u2, and u3 gates.
- Analyze and measure the calibration circuit using the optimal pulse and compare against the original circuit:
	- Horizontally compare results using the same gates and different pulse values.
	- Vertically compare results between different gates and the same pulse values.
	- Ensure greater fidelity of the error correcting circuit.
- Once the calibration circuit has been verified to reduce noisy results, redefine what the basis vectors, |0> and |1>, mean.

After experimentation has been done to find the best pulse to minimize the noise, or error, in the low-level u1, u2, and u3 gates, construct new circuits for each gate that incorporates the noise correction pulse.
- Once the new u1, u2, and u3 gate circuits have been constructed, the circuits must be simulated on a real quantum machine in order to prove a higher fidelity of results compared to the original u1, u2, u3 gate results. The machine we will use to test the new circuit will be the IBM Q Hub at NC State.
- Using the new, less noisy, u1, u2, and u3 gates, standard gates such as NOT, CNOT, Pauli, Hadamart, etc. must be rewritten automatically.
- Again, we must verify our results by running the newly developed standard gate circuits on a real quantum machine by comparing the results against the original standard gates.


**Future Work**
- Enlarge the Gaussian pulse width research samples
- Conduct experiments with more precise methods to calculate the pulse values more accurately
- Extend and fine-tune the calibration circuit to perform pulse calibration on multi-qubit machines
- Use the multi-qubit calibrated pulse parameters to generate Pulse Schedule for CNOT gate
- Calibrating pulses for maximum performance on your hardware:
    - Use a waveform generator to calibrate and correct discrepancies between the pulse
